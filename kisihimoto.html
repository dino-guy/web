    <p><h1>Biography:</h1><br><br>
    <h3><u> Early Life</u></h3>
     Masashi Kishimoto was born in the Okayama Prefecture, Japan on November 8, 1974 as the older identical twin of Seishi Kishimoto. During his childhood, Kishimoto showed interest in drawing characters from the anime shows he watched, such as Dr. Slump's Arale and Doraemon's titular protagonist.
     In elementary school, Kishimoto started watching the Kinnikuman and Dragon Ball anime alongside his brother. During the following years, Kishimoto started idolising Dragon Ball's author Akira Toriyama, enjoying not only his series Dragon Ball and Dr. Slump, but also Dragon Quest, a role-playing video game for which Toriyama was art designer.
     While he could not afford to buy Weekly Shōnen Jump where the Dragon Ball manga was published, he followed the series thanks to a friend from school who had subscribed to the magazine. By high school, Kishimoto started losing interest in manga as he started playing baseball and basketball, sports he practised at his school. However, upon seeing a poster for the animated film Akira, Kishimoto became fascinated with the way the illustration was made and wished to imitate the series' creator Katsuhiro Otomo's style. 
     During his last years of school, Kishimoto spent time drawing manga and went to an art college with hopes that he would become a manga artist.
     Upon entering college, Kishimoto decided he should try creating a Chanbara manga since Weekly Shōnen Jump had not published a title from that genre. However, during the same years, Kishimoto started reading Hiroaki Samura's Blade of the Immortal and Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin which used such genre. 
     Kishimoto recalls having never been surprised by manga ever since reading Akira and found that he still was not able to compete against them. In his second year of college, Kishimoto started drawing manga for magazine contests. However, he noted that his works were similar to seinen manga, aimed towards a young adult demographic, rather than the shōnen manga read by children. Wishing to write a manga for Shōnen Jump that targets a young demographic, Kishimoto found his style unsuitable for the magazine. 
     When watching the anime series Hashire Melos!, Kishimoto was surprised by the character designs employed by the animators and he started researching works from animators. 
     He later met Tetsuya Nishio, designer from the anime adaptation of the manga Ninku who he deemed as a big influence.
     Now emulating the way of drawing from multiple character designers from anime series, Kishimoto noted that his style started resembling shōnen series.
        
    <h3> <u>Works:</u></h3>
    Kishimoto's first successful manga pilot was Karakuri (カラクリ, literally meaning: Mechanism), which he submitted to Shueisha in 1995. This earned him an honourable mention in Shueisha's monthly "Hop Step Award" in 1996, granted to promising rookie manga artists.At this point he was assigned an editor, Kosuke Yahagi, and worked on a number of rejected drafts including a slice-of-life manga, Michikusa (道くさ, literally meaning: Wandering Detour), and an action manga, Asian Punk (アジアンパンク, Ajian Panku).
    In 1997 he wrote a one-shot version of Naruto which was published in Akamaru Jump Summer and was well received, but proved difficult to rework into a continuing series.   
    In December 1997, while redeveloping Karakuri for serialisation, Kishimoto was offered a one-shot in Weekly Shōnen Jump. Hampered by the sudden deadline, a reworked Karakuri debuted two weeks later in Weekly Shōnen Jump 1998 No. 4-5, but performed poorly in reader surveys and was immediately cancelled. 
    Following the failure of Karakuri, Kishimoto reduced his output and began moving in a seinen direction with drafts for a baseball manga, Yakyūō (野球王, literally meaning: Baseball King), and a mafia manga, Mario (マリオ), hoping to find better luck with a seinen magazine. 
    Yahagi persuaded him to give the shōnen genre one last shot and Kishimoto began working on storyboards for a fantasy one-shot, Magic Mushroom (マジックマッシュルーム, Majikku Masshurūmu), but stopped when Yahagi called and asked him to instead develop storyboards for serialisation.
    The two decided to submit a version of Naruto with a reworked story and world and produced storyboards for the first three chapters, winning a spot in the magazine. With a six-month lead time, Kishimoto repeatedly revised and redrew the first several chapters of the series. 
    In September 1999, the serialised version of Naruto premiered in Weekly Shōnen Jump 1999 No. 43 and quickly became a hit. Naruto ended on November 10, 2014 after more than 15 years of serialisation, with a total of 700 chapters collected in 72 volumes. Sales have exceeded 113 million copies in Japan and over 95 million copies in the US,
    followed by over 93 million copies worldwide (outside Japan and United States) as of volume 36. It was adapted into two successful anime series. The Naruto manga series became one of Viz Media's top properties,accounting for nearly 10% of all manga sales in the US in 2006. 
    The seventh volume of Viz's release became the first manga to ever win a Quill Award when it claimed the award for "Best Graphic Novel" in 2006. 
    Responding to Naruto's success, Kishimoto said in Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008 that he was "very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste... 
    because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them."   
    Two of his former assistants, Osamu Kajisa (Tattoo Hearts) and Yuuichi Itakura (Hand's), have gone on to moderate success following their work on Naruto.
    In 2009, Kishimoto designed an extra costume for the video game character Lars Alexandersson for Tekken 6; in 2010 this character appeared in Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 as part of a special cross-promotion.
    In 2010, Kishimoto produced a one-shot baseball manga, Bench (ベンチ, Benchi), as part of Jump's "Top of the Super Legend" project, a series of six one-shot manga by famed Weekly Shōnen Jump artists.   
    For the ninth Naruto film, Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie, Kishimoto was responsible for both the story and characters' designs.
    To promote the film, Kishimoto worked in Motion Comic Naruto a DVD that shows scenes from the manga in 3D that was given to the first 1.5 million people who went to the cinema. Regarding Naruto's publication Kishimoto told Tetsuya Nishio in July 2012 that the series would take over a year and a half to end. 
    However, Kishimoto admitted that it now appears that the manga will continue beyond that timeframe.
    In April, 2012, it was announced that Kishimoto would publish a one-shot version of his long-postponed mafia manga, Mario, in Jump Square,[26] based on the rough, 160-page manuscript he began working on before Naruto became serialised.   
    Throughout 2013, several of Kishimoto's one-shots saw their English-language debut in issues of the Weekly Shonen Jump digital magazine, including Mario, Bench, and the original Naruto pilot.
    <u>Masashi was involved in the production of the 2014 game Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution where he created new designs and additions for characters, such as Mecha-Naruto and Mecha-Kurama, pre-Akatsuki designs for Sasori, Kakuzu and Hidan, Shisui Uchiha's and Itachi Uchiha's Complete Body Susanoo, as well as editorial supervision for the three playable stories, Ninja Escapades.</u>
    Kishimoto was also the winner of "Rookie of the Year" for the series in the Agency for Cultural Affairs.
    On 10 November 2014, Kishimoto ended the 15-year run of Naruto. By the end of the publication, Naruto had spanned 72 volumes and (as of September 2014) generated global sales of 200 million copies. 
    After a two year break, Kishimoto announced he was going to aid the new Boruto anime premiering in 2017, as well as help the Live Action Naruto Movie that is being produced by Lionsgate.
    On May 13, 2019, Masashi Kishimoto had begun publication of his newest manga series Samurai 8: The Tale of Hachimaru which ended on March 23, 2020, spanning 43 chapters for a total of five volumes,
    which like Naruto was also serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump and licensed by VIZ for an English release in their new Shōnen Jump release format.
    On November 16, 2020, it was announced that Kishimoto had taken over writing duties on the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations manga from Kodachi beginning with chapter 52, with Ikemoto continuing as illustrator.</p>
